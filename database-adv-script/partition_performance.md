# Partitioning Performance Report

## Implementation Overview
- Partitioned the `booking` table by `start_date` range
- Created 5 partitions:
  - Historical data (pre-2023)
  - Yearly partitions (2023, 2024, 2025)
  - Future bookings (2026+)
- Maintained all constraints and indexes
- Migrated existing data to the partitioned table

## Performance Tests

### Test Query 1: Date Range Query
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM booking_partitioned
WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2024-06-01' AND '2024-12-31';
